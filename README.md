# INFO474 Data Visualization Assignment #2

<b>live site:</b> http://students.washington.edu/sangkim1/info474/INFO474_Visual2/

In this assignment, I decided to use Global Sport Finances dataset in order to visually present average salary of Athletes based on their Annual Income and Endorsement.
The user can use Visuallization Control in order to control which data is being visualized, and how. 
I decided to create two controls, controller for sport type and controller for amount of total income. With these two controller, users can dynamically interact with the chart to gain information that they want. User can know who gets the  highest salary, or highest Endorsement, or highest total income. It is also easy to determine which group have higher total income than other groups. I also decided to visually encode data as scatter plot, because I wanted to show the relationship of salary, endorsemen, and kind of sport. I hope you enjoy!
